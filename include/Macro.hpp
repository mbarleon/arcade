 * @details
 * This file defines standard return codes used throughout the project:
 * - `SUCCESS` is used to indicate successful execution (value 0).
 * - `ERROR` is used to indicate a generic failure (value 84).
 *
 * These codes are typically returned by the `main` function and
 * can also be used in internal error handling.
